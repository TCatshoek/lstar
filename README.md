This repo contains the code I originally wrote for my [master thesis](https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid%3A8e5486e4-da37-43ac-8653-3f1e87a95253?collection=education) at TU Delft. 
A cleaned up, neatly packaged version is available at https://github.com/TCatshoek/STMLearn

This repository will remain available for reproducibility, but if you want to use it for anything I highly recommend checking out the link above instead.

Not everything has been ported over yet, so bear with me while I clean up and neatly package everything and move it over to the library :)
